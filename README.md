Using K - Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier predicting Heart diseases

## Problem:

Using heart diseases dataset performed KNN Classification algorithm to predict patient with heart diseases and without heart diseases based on different features.

## About KNN:

K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.
It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.
KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.
